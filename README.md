# EZPing

### Enables you to check your ping with a very simple command!!

## Information
With this plugin, I made it very simple for both the host, and the player to check their ping! All you do is type /ping and your ping in milliseconds will show and also a custom message set by the host in the config.yml file! Choose from five different ranges to set (Defaults are: Excellent, Good, Ok, Poor, Extremely Poor).
