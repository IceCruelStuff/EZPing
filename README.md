## Information
With this plugin, I made it very simple for both the host, and the player to check their ping! All you do is use the command '/ping' and your ping in the form of milliseconds will show and also a custom message indicating the overall quality of the connection set by the host in the config.yml file! Choose from five different ranges to set (Defaults are: Excellent, Good, Ok, Poor, Extremely Poor). You can also use the command '/ping \<player-name>' to get another player's ping status!

You can find more info here on the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/Xenophilicy/EZPing/wiki)
